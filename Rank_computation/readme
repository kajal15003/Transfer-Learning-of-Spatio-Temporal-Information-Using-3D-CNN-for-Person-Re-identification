Rank_computationFolder:- 
Drone Video features extracted from 3D-CNN stored with drone_ftr.txt in the folder. and Labels are stored with name drone_lbl.txt

#Computation of Rank Similarity. File will be run in the following order

1.distance_cl1.m -- Calculate Eucledian Norm of Drone Features From drone_ftr file saved in distance.txt
2.min_n2.m -- Computation of Minimum Distance saved in rnk.txt 
3.gtnidx3.m -- Mark ground truth saved in idx.txt and ground_truth.txt
4.predict4.m -- Predict Id's saved in predict.txt
5.rank_clc5.m -- Computation of Rank Similarity(Rank-1 to Rank-20)
